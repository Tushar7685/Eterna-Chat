## EternaChat

A Real-Time Chat Application

Introducing EternaChat, a real-time chat application designed to enhance your communication experience. Built with React JS for creating dynamic user interfaces, EternaChat is powered by Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB for a robust backend.

Using React's component-based architecture, we create reusable components in JSX and ES6, and bundle them with Webpack 5 for a smooth production build.

Our backend combines Node JS and Express JS with MongoDB for scalable data management. With MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage and Socket.io for real-time communication, EternaChat keeps you connected without any delay.

EternaChat is fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a seamless user experience no matter where you are. Enjoy real-time chatting with EternaChat!
